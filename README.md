Overview:

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict Nvidia’s stock prices. By incorporating sentiment analysis from news headlines, it aims to improve predictions based on market sentiment. The model is trained on historical stock data and evaluates the performance of predictions against actual stock prices.

Key Features:

Predicts stock prices using LSTM, a time-series forecasting model.
Enhances predictions with sentiment analysis derived from financial news.
Includes technical indicators like SMA, RSI, and MACD to capture market trends.
Evaluates model performance by comparing predicted and actual prices.
Conclusion
The LSTM model successfully captures the trends in Nvidia’s stock prices, with sentiment analysis improving the prediction by considering market mood. However, as stock markets are volatile and affected by multiple unpredictable factors, the system provides an informed estimate but should not be used for real-world trading without further enhancement.
